<h2><b> About the Black Footed Cat </b></h2>
<p>The black-footed cat, also called the small-spotter cat, is the smallest
   wild cat in Africa and is endemic to the southwestern arid zone of Southern 
   Africa. This cat has a lifespan of 10 years (in captivity) and can be up to
   9.8 inches tall. These black-footed cats are found only in three countries of 
   Southern Africa: Botswana, Namibia, and South Africa. </p>
   
<h3><b> Where do they live? </b></h3>
<p>Black-footed cats are nocturnal inhabitants of the arid lands of southern Africa, 
   and are typically associated with open, sandy, grassy habitats with sparse scrub and 
   tree cover. Their habitats seem to be savannah areas with long grass and higher rodent
   and bird densities. During the day, these cats live in abandoned burrows dug or in 
   holes in termite mounds. </p>

<h4><b> Conservation </b></h4> <!--Make heading bold-->
<p>The African Black-footed cat is rare compared to the other small cats of
   southern Africa. Some threats that these cats face are poisoned baits
   and traps, as well as poisoned locusts which are their preferred food. There
   is also a loss of grassland due to overgrazing by livestock that is prevalent
   throughout the species' range, which could be their biggest threat. Another big threat
   can be the habitat deterioration that led to reductions of the cat's small 
   vertebrate prey base.</p>

<h5><b> Fun Facts </b></h5>
<p>These black-footed cats is a nocturnal animal that travels upp to 5 miles per night to 
   find food. They can kill and eat up to 14 small animals per night. Also, these cats rarely 
   drink water, so they absorb the moisture from their food instead. Another name for the black-footed 
   cat is "miershooptier", also meaning "anthill tiger". This refers to the aggressive behavior that 
   is a characteristic for the corned black-footed cats. Lastly, these black-footed cats can 
   survive up to 13 years in the captivity. </p>
