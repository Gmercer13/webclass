        <p>Victoria Woodhull was the seventh of ten children in her family. 
           As a child, she received just 3 years of schooling from elementary 
           school, but always believed she was destined for great things.  At 
           age 15, she married 28 year old Canning Woodhull.  Victoria had 2 
           children with Canning and worked constantly to pay for his alcoholic 
           habits. She was rumored to have been a cigar girl, stage girl, and 
           waitress.  Shortly after in 1864, she divorced Canning and remained a 
           single mother. </p>
        <p>Victoria was an American leader of the women's suffrage movement and was the first woman to run 
           for President of the United States in 1872.  Because of her second marriage 
           in 1866 and divorce in 1876, she supported the freedom to marry, divorce, 
           and bear children without government intervention.  Along with this, she 
           also supported the legalization of prostitution. </p>  
        <p>Victoria was a strong supporter of women's rights. She spoke publicly about 
           women's suffrage and even addressed Congress about the issue. This is when 
           she met and became friends with <a href="https://www.biography.com/people/benjamin-f-butler-9233056" target="_blank"> 
           Benjamin Butler</a>, a Massachusetts politician and Union officer. </p>
        <p>Woodhull and her sister started to work for <a href="https://www.biography.com/people/cornelius-vanderbilt-9515195">
           Cornelius Vanderbilt</a> as clairvoyants when he did not trust doctors. This helped build his trust in him and led to 
           them gaining money. After having a relationship with Vanderbilt and him backing them financially, Victoria and her sister, 
           Tennessee, started a firm named Woodhull, Claflin & Co. This made them the first female stock brokers on Wall Street.
           In conclusion, Victoria Woodhull was an influential and innovative woman during her time period. </p>
