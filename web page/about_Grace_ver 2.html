        <Hr />
        
        <p>I was born on <b>February 19</b> and in Delaware. I grew up and currently live in Dover Delaware. 
        I love <b>traveling</b> and I do not enjoy cold weather so I would like to live in Florida some day. </p> 
        <p>I went to Saint Annes Episcopal School for elementary- eight grade.  My favorite class is 
        science. When I am older, I would like to be a pediatric nurse. </p>
        <p>I have many hobbies which include playing <b>soccer and field hockey</b>, listening to music, running,
        and <b>sleeping</b>.  I do not like to read or write so I spend my time listening to music or 
        watching Netflix. My favorite color is blue.</p>  <blockquote >"life is good"</blockquote>
        <p>My favorite Disney movie is <i>The Lion King</i>
